## Data Manipulation, Importing &amp; Cleaning Data

In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The data provided by The World Bank includes both national and regional debt statistics for several countries worldwide, recorded from 1970 to 2015. The dataset consists of 2357 records.
